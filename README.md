# Model Library for External Authentication with SonicOS by SonicWALL

Library containing models to interact with SonicOS by SonicWALL for external authentication

This is a model repo for CaptivePortal - but there's more... coming soon!

### Platform

This library is built against [.NET Standard 1.4](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/schema/target-frameworks#net-platform-standard).

Also we are staying on the project.json based tooling until Visual Studio 2017 has been released - IOW you need to use Visual Studio
Update 3 with the preview ASP.NET Core tooling.

### How to build

* [Install](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core#/current) .NET Core 1.1 
* Run build.ps1 from Powershell
